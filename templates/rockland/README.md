# Preprocessing

Preprocessing for the templates was done using `SPM12, version 7771 (standalone)` and `CAT12.8.1 r1980`, also standalone, on `MATLAB, version 9.3.0.713579 (R2017b)`.

# Missing templates

Please note that there were not enough individual subjects (i.e., less than 15) contributing to

 * 54Msmwp1_{mean,std}.nii.gz

and therefore these templates do not exist.
